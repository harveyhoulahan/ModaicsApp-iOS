# Modaics iOS App

**Modaics** is a SwiftUI-based iOS application prototype for a circular, AI-powered fashion platform. It implements a five-tab bottom navigation interface with the following sections:

1. **Home** – Personalized feed and AI-driven recommendations  
2. **Discover** – Search for clothing, brands, and events  
3. **Sell** – Create and manage listings, host pop-ups  
4. **Community** – Brand “Sketchbook” pages, discussion forums  
5. **Profile** – Personal wardrobe, settings, and account info  

This repository contains a minimal scaffold: placeholder views for each tab, ready to be extended with real UI layouts, network calls, and AI integration.
